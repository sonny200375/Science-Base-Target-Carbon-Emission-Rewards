# Science Base Target Carbon Emission Rewards
Science Based Target Carbon Emission Rewards is Simple Plutus Program as part ofset ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with  the latest climate science. It is focused on accelerating companies across the world to halve emissions  before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050
The main objective of this standard is to provide a standardized and robust approach for corporates to set netzero targets that are aligned with climate science.
Near-term science-based targets galvanize the action required for significant emissions reductions to be achieved by 2030. Near-term emissions reductions are critical to not exceeding the global emissions budget and are not interchangeable with long-term targets.

# THE SCIENCE BEHIND SCIENCE-BASED NET-ZERO TARGETS
As described in SR15, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach netzero CO2  emissions around 2050, accompanied by rapid reductions in non-CO2  GHG emissions. 
These scenarios entail profound transitions in the global energy, industry, urban, and land systems that involve:
• Full or near-full decarbonization for energy and industrial CO2 emissions achieving a zero-emissions energy supply system by mid-century.
• Eliminating CO2  emissions associated with agriculture, forestry, and land-use
• Deep reductions in non-CO2  emissions from all sectors.
• Removing CO2  from the atmosphere to neutralize residual emissions and, potentially, sustain net negative emissions that reduce cumulative CO2  in the atmosphere over-time

# THE SCIENCE-BASED NET-ZERO TARGETS SCOPE BOUNDARY
This Simple Application simulated rewarding features for Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) companies in setting science based targets for greenhouse gases (GHGs) according to a set of new decarbonisation pathways, described in detail in Recommendation ITU-T L.1470 ‘GHG emissions trajectories for the ICT sector compatible with the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’1  and aligned to the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C and developed to be used as a sectoral target-setting approach by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).
